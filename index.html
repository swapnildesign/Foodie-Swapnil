        <p>If you’re not sure about Chinese food, you need to get to know Fuchsia Dunlop, the foremost expert on the cuisine in the western world. Her writing (if you’re not a cook, head first for her memoir Shark’s Fin and Sichuan Pepper) is as tasty as
            her recipes. Every Grain of Rice sets out to re-educate the British palate’s coarse and generalised appreciation for the subtleties of flavour and texture in Chinese food Fans of Mexican cooking will know there are few places in the UK to
            source authentic corn tortillas or the flour for making your own, a tortilla press or a can of tomatillos. You’ll find all these and many branded Mexican foods including snacks, herbs and spices on Mex Grocer.</p>

            <p>If you’re going to treat yourself to butter — and you should — make it count by smearing only the very best on your bread. Netherend Farm in Gloucestershire produces organic butter for many top-end clients (Claridge’s, Dukes Hotel and the
                Orient Express), but you can also find it in Waitrose, and it’s no more expensive than other branded butter.</p>
